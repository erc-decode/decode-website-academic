We find that activity of an evolved version of the most widely used APOBEC1 deaminase is attenuated within the temperature range commonly used for culturing Drosophila (18-29°C) and many other ectothermic species. In contrast, an evolved CDA1 domain functions with remarkable efficiency within the same temperature range. Furthermore, we show that formation of undesired indel mutations and C-to-G/A edits is exceptionally rare in Drosophila compared to other species. The predictable editing outcome, very high efficiency and minimal byproduct formation of this system allows for near homogeneous biallelic gene inactivation in vivo in a ubiquitous or conditional manner.

Here, we evaluate the CRISPR-Cas9 system in Drosophila melanogaster to assess its ability to induce stem cell-derived tumors in the intestine. We generated conditional tissue-specific CRISPR knockouts using different Cas9 expression vectors with guide RNAs targeting the BMP, Notch, and JNK pathways in intestinal progenitors such as stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs). Perturbing Notch and BMP signaling increased the proliferation of ISCs/EBs and resulted in the formation of intestinal tumors, albeit with different efficiencies. By assessing both the anterior and posterior regions of the midgut, we observed regional differences in ISC/EB proliferation and tumor formation upon mutagenesis. Surprisingly, high continuous expression of Cas9 in ISCs/EBs blocked age-dependent increase in ISCs/EBs proliferation and when combined with gRNAs targeting tumor suppressors, it prevented tumorigenesis. However, no such effects were seen when temporal parameters of Cas9 were adjusted to regulate its expression levels or with a genetically modified version, which expresses Cas9 at lower levels, suggesting that fine-tuning Cas9 expression is essential to avoid deleterious effects. Our findings suggest that modifications to Cas9 expression results in differences in editing efficiency and careful considerations are required when choosing reagents for CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis studies. In summary, Drosophila can serve as a powerful model for context-dependent CRISPR-Cas based perturbations and to test genome-editing systems in vivo.\n","tags":["Boutros Group"],"title":"Conditional CRISPR-Cas Genome Editing in Drosophila to Generate Intestinal Tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze","Wolfgang Huber"],"categories":["New Paper"],"content":"The paper explores the effect of different variance stabilizing transformations on the downstream analysis of single-cell data.

Despite this fundamental split, our current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanism driving root development is mainly based on studies of the dicot model Arabidopsis. However, the world major crops are monocots and little is known about the transcriptional programs underlying cell-type specification in this clade. Here, we report the transcriptomes of more than 20 000 single cells derived from root tips of two agronomically important rice cultivars. Using combined computational and experimental analyses we were able to robustly identify most of the major cell types and define novel cell-type-specific marker genes for both cultivars. Importantly, we found divergent cell types associated with specific regulatory programs, including phytohormone biosynthesis, signaling, and response, which were well conserved between the two rice cultivars. In addition, we detected substantial differences between the cell-type transcript profiles of Arabidopsis and rice. These species-specific features emphasize the importance of analyzing tissues across diverse model species, including rice. Taken together, our study provides insight into the transcriptomic landscape of major cell types of rice root tip at single-cell resolution and opens new avenues to study cell-type specification, function, and evolution in plants.\n","tags":["Lohmann Group"],"title":"Transcriptional landscape of rice roots at the single-cell resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze","Wolfgang Huber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607472e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607472e3,"objectID":"c645fef8a14c774aed5333058e87b129","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/publication/ahlmann-eltze-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahlmann-eltze-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"**Motivation:** The Gamma-Poisson distribution is a theoretically and empirically motivated model for the sampling variability of single cell RNA-sequencing counts and an essential building block for analysis approaches including differential expression analysis, principal component analysis and factor analysis. Existing implementations for inferring its parameters from data often struggle with the size of single cell datasets, which can comprise millions of cells; at the same time, they do not take full advantage of the fact that zero and other small numbers are frequent in the data. These limitations have hampered uptake of the model, leaving room for statistically inferior approaches such as logarithm(-like) transformation.\n\n**Results:** We present a new R package for fitting the Gamma-Poisson distribution to data with the characteristics of modern single cell datasets more quickly and more accurately than existing methods.

The scripts to reproduce the results of this paper are available on [github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi-Paper](https://github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi-Paper).\n\n**Supplementary information:** Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n","tags":["Huber Group","Bioinformatics"],"title":"glmGamPoi: fitting Gamma-Poisson generalized linear models on single cell count data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fillip Port","Maja Starostecka","Michael Boutros"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"94215b6cc783b719d4fb886245eb59c4","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/publication/port-2020a/","publishdate":"2020-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/port-2020a/","section":"publication","summary":"CRISPR-Cas genome engineering has revolutionized biomedical research by enabling targeted genome modification with unprecedented ease. In the popular model organism Drosophila melanogaster, gene editing has so far relied exclusively on the prototypical CRISPR nuclease Cas9. Additional CRISPR systems could expand the genomic target space, offer additional modes of regulation, and enable the independent manipulation of genes in different cells of the same animal. Here we describe a platform for efficient Cas12a gene editing in Drosophila. We show that Cas12a from Lachnospiraceae bacterium, but not Acidaminococcus spec., can mediate robust gene editing in vivo. In combination with most CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), LbCas12a activity is high at 29 °C, but low at 18 °C, enabling modulation of gene editing by temperature. LbCas12a can directly utilize compact crRNA arrays that are substantially easier to construct than Cas9 single-guide RNA arrays, facilitating multiplex genome engineering. Furthermore, we show that conditional expression of LbCas12a is sufficient to mediate tightly controlled gene editing in a variety of tissues, allowing detailed analysis of gene function in a multicellular organism. We also test a variant of LbCas12a with a D156R point mutation and show that it has substantially higher activity and outperforms a state-of-the-art Cas9 system in identifying essential genes. Cas12a gene editing expands the genome-engineering toolbox in Drosophila and will be a powerful method for the functional annotation of the genome. This work also presents a fully genetically encoded Cas12a system in an animal, laying out principles for the development of similar systems in other genetically tractable organisms for multiplexed conditional genome engineering.\n","tags":["Boutros Group","Drosophila"],"title":"Multiplexed conditional genome editing with Cas12a in Drosophila","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fillip Port","Claudia Strein","Mona Stricker","Benedikt Rauscher","Florian Heigwer","Jun Zhou","Celine Beyersdörffer","Jana Frei","Amy Hess","Katharina Kern","Laura Lange","Nora Langner","Roberta Malamud","Bojana Pavlović","Kristin Rädecke","Lukas Schmitt","Lukas Voos","Erica Valentini","Michael Boutros"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581552e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581552e3,"objectID":"a53c832ce089225ebc3a046e58076e01","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/publication/port-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/port-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic screens are powerful tools for the functional annotation of genomes. In the context of multicellular organisms, interrogation of gene function is greatly facilitated by methods that allow spatial and temporal control of gene abrogation. Here, we describe a large-scale transgenic short guide (sg) RNA library for efficient CRISPR-based disruption of specific target genes in a constitutive or conditional manner. The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1700 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4/UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption. Furthermore, we conducted the so far largest fully transgenic CRISPR screen in any metazoan organism, which further supported the high efficiency and accuracy of our library and revealed many so far uncharacterized genes essential for development.","tags":["Boutros Group","Drosophila"],"title":"A large-scale resource for tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis in Drosophila","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"…\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"…","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
