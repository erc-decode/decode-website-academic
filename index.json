Existing factor analysis models assume independence of the observed samples, an assumption that fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies.

MEFISTO maintains the established benefits of factor analysis for multimodal data, but enables the performance of spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation, and separation of smooth from non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different datasets with spatial or temporal resolution, including an evolutionary atlas of organ development, a longitudinal microbiome study, a single-cell multi-omics atlas of mouse gastrulation and spatially resolved transcriptomics.\n","tags":["Stegle Group","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Identifying temporal and spatial patterns of variation from multimodal data using MEFISTO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Huber"],"categories":null,"content":"Your role As part of the research team, you will participate in the overall project and shape your own research profile in one or several of the following areas:\n Conduct integrative data analysis for biological discovery in:  Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis at ultra-large scale; High-throughput CRISPR-KO perturbation analysis Imaging-based phenotyping;   Develop novel computational methods using multivariate statistics, Bayesian inference and manifold learning Model cell states, transitions and genetic dependencies; Model gene-gene and gene-environment interactions; Data science, quality assurance, advanced visualization and model checking; Develop scalable and robust software for scientific computing; Probabilistic models of genetic causal networks using latent spaces, categories, graphs and dynamic processe.

Here, we describe three transformations (based on the delta method, model residuals, or inferred latent expression state) and compare their strengths and weaknesses.

In the popular model organism Drosophila melanogaster, gene editing has so far relied exclusively on the prototypical CRISPR nuclease Cas9. Additional CRISPR systems could expand the genomic target space, offer additional modes of regulation, and enable the independent manipulation of genes in different cells of the same animal. Here we describe a platform for efficient Cas12a gene editing in Drosophila. We show that Cas12a from Lachnospiraceae bacterium, but not Acidaminococcus spec., can mediate robust gene editing in vivo. In combination with most CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), LbCas12a activity is high at 29 °C, but low at 18 °C, enabling modulation of gene editing by temperature. LbCas12a can directly utilize compact crRNA arrays that are substantially easier to construct than Cas9 single-guide RNA arrays, facilitating multiplex genome engineering. Furthermore, we show that conditional expression of LbCas12a is sufficient to mediate tightly controlled gene editing in a variety of tissues, allowing detailed analysis of gene function in a multicellular organism. We also test a variant of LbCas12a with a D156R point mutation and show that it has substantially higher activity and outperforms a state-of-the-art Cas9 system in identifying essential genes. Cas12a gene editing expands the genome-engineering toolbox in Drosophila and will be a powerful method for the functional annotation of the genome. This work also presents a fully genetically encoded Cas12a system in an animal, laying out principles for the development of similar systems in other genetically tractable organisms for multiplexed conditional genome engineering.\n","tags":["Boutros Group","Drosophila"],"title":"Multiplexed conditional genome editing with Cas12a in Drosophila","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fillip Port","Claudia Strein","Mona Stricker","Benedikt Rauscher","Florian Heigwer","Jun Zhou","Celine Beyersdörffer","Jana Frei","Amy Hess","Katharina Kern","Laura Lange","Nora Langner","Roberta Malamud","Bojana Pavlović","Kristin Rädecke","Lukas Schmitt","Lukas Voos","Erica Valentini","Michael Boutros"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581552e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581552e3,"objectID":"a53c832ce089225ebc3a046e58076e01","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/publication/port-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decode-website-academic/publication/port-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic screens are powerful tools for the functional annotation of genomes. In the context of multicellular organisms, interrogation of gene function is greatly facilitated by methods that allow spatial and temporal control of gene abrogation. Here, we describe a large-scale transgenic short guide (sg) RNA library for efficient CRISPR-based disruption of specific target genes in a constitutive or conditional manner. The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1700 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4/UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption. Furthermore, we conducted the so far largest fully transgenic CRISPR screen in any metazoan organism, which further supported the high efficiency and accuracy of our library and revealed many so far uncharacterized genes essential for development.","tags":["Boutros Group","Drosophila"],"title":"A large-scale resource for tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis in Drosophila","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"…\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/decode-website-academic/privacy/","section":"","summary":"…","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decode-website-academic/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decode-website-academic/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://erc-decode.github.io/decode-website-academic/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decode-website-academic/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
