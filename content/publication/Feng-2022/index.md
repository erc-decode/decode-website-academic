title: 'Chromatin accessibility illuminates single-cell regulatory dynamics of rice root tips'
abstract: |
    Root development and function have central roles in plant adaptation to the environment. The modification of root traits has additionally been a major driver of crop performance since the green revolution; however, the molecular underpinnings and the regulatory programmes defining root development and response to environmental stress remain largely unknown. Single-cell reconstruction of gene regulatory programmes provides an important tool to understand the cellular phenotypic variation in complex tissues and their response to endogenous and environmental stimuli. While single-cell transcriptomes of several plant organs have been elucidated, the underlying chromatin landscapes associated with cell type-specific gene expression remain largely unexplored.
