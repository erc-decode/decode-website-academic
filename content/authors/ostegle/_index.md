# Stegle group

The interests of the Stegle group lie in computational methods to unravel the genotypeâ€“phenotype map on a genome-wide scale. How do genetic background and environment jointly shape phenotypic traits or causes diseases? How are genetic and external factors integrated at different molecular layers, and how variable are molecular states between individual cells?


## Role in the project

In the DECODE project, the Stegle lab is closely collaborating with the Huber lab to establish the computational foundation for the project. In doing so, we will develop computational methods for unravelling causal dependencies in cellular networks. We are particularly interested in deploying multi-omics approaches and tying together perturbation states with phenotypic consequences.
