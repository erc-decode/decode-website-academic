# Huber group

The Huber group studies biological systems by developing statistical and bioinformatic methods for the analysis of new data types and large systematic datasets: single-cell profiling, multi-omics, high-throughput drug- or CRISPR-based perturbation assays, and quantitative imaging. Our projects range from applied data analysis for biological discovery to theoretical method development; our biological systems of interest from fundamental models of tissue biology to blood cancers. We maintain an extensive network of collaborations. These include the Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU) 'Systems Medicine of Cancer Drugs', the ERC Synergy project DECODE, the ELLIS unit Heidelberg, and our contributions to the Bioconductor project.
