This repository contains the source for the main ERC DECODE project website.
The website is primarily built from Markdown and RMarkdown files using the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/) R package together with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
It currently uses the [Academic Resume](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) Hugo theme.
The website is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
